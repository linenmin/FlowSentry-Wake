/**
 * @class OCSort
 * @brief Implementation of the OC-SORT and Deep-OCSORT multi-object tracking algorithms.
 *
 * This tracker supports ReID embeddings for association (Deep-OCSORT) and includes a memory bank
 * to recover the correct person ID when an individual leaves the scene and reappears later.
 *
 * The memory bank stores all lost tracks and, when a new track is created, checks whether the object
 * has been seen before (i.e., is in the memory bank) or is a new object. Tracks near the image boundary
 * are considered for recovery after a certain number of frames, and tracks inside the scene are considered
 * after a longer period. Tracks must meet certain criteria (e.g., minimum age) to be stored in the memory bank.
 * When a new track is created, it is compared with tracks in the memory bank using embedding similarity.
 * If the similarity is above a certain threshold, the track is merged with the corresponding memory bank entry.
