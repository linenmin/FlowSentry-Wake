## Prerequisites
- Complete [Application Integration](application.md) - understand single-model pipelines
- Understanding of object detection and classification tasks
- Familiarity with YAML pipeline configuration
- Knowledge of how to filter detections by class

## Level
**Advanced** - Requires understanding of multi-stage inference and task chaining

## Overview

- [Build a cascade pipeline](#build-a-cascade-pipeline)

A cascade pipeline with ssd-mobilenetv1 to detect selected objects and resnet50 for further
classification is included with the SDK to demonstrate this functionality. The YAML pipeline
definition for this example is found at `ax_models/cascade/ssd-mobilenetv1-resnet50.yaml`. You can
deploy and run the model by:

```bash
inference.py ssd-mobilenetv1-resnet50 <usb/video>
```

In this example, the object detector will find all bottles, and the classifier further categorizes
the object into subcategories like red wine, white wine, and beer. Since "bottle" is among the
classes identified by the COCO dataset, and ImageNet includes specific categories such as
"red wine," "white wine," and "beer," it's feasible to seamlessly integrate the detector and
classifier trained on these datasets. In object detection pipelines, we can easily add a "tracker"
to track objects of a certain class. Below is a high-level representation of the pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
  - SSD-MobileNetV1-COCO:
      template_path: $AXELERA_FRAMEWORK/pipeline-template/ssd-tensorflow.yaml
      postprocess:
        - decode-ssd-mobilenet:
            conf_threshold: 0.4
            label_filter: bottle
            overwrite_labels: True
        - tracker:
            algorithm: sort # support list: oc-sort, bytetrack, sort, scalarmot
  - ResNet50-ImageNet1K:
      input:
        type: image
        source: roi
        where: SSD-MobileNetV1-COCO
        label_filter: bottle
        which: CENTER # AREA, SCORE, CENTER
        top_k: 10
      preprocess:
        - torch-totensor:
        - normalize:
            mean: 0.485, 0.456, 0.406
            std: 0.229, 0.224, 0.225
      postprocess:
        - topk:
            k: 1
            labels: $$labels$$
            num_classes: $$num_classes$$
```

In actual applications, this pipeline can have many extended uses, such as first detecting cars,
then classifying the cars into corresponding makes/models or model years.

- **Deploy custom cascades**: Combine your own models using patterns from this tutorial
- **Optimize performance**: [Compiler Configs](../reference/compiler_configs.md) for multi-model optimization
- **Add tracking**: Extend cascades with object tracking (see tracker examples in Model Zoo)
