Some customers may have boards where updating the flash is not enabled by default. This guide will help you enable firmware updates on these boards.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- Administrative privileges on your system
- Internet connection to download required files

## Steps to Enable Firmware Updates

### Step 1: Install Voyager SDK

First, you need to install the Voyager SDK following the official setup instructions:

1. Visit the [Voyager SDK Quick Start Guide](/docs/tutorials/quick_start_guide.md#setup)
2. Follow the setup instructions to install the Voyager SDK on your system
3. Make sure to run the Step 2 and Step 3 below in a prompt with the (venv) activated from the guide above

### Step 2: Download the Bootloader Update File

Download the required bootloader update file:

```bash
wget https://axelera-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/aipu_firmware_enabler/voyager-sdk-v1.4.0/enable_bootloader_update.sh
chmod +x enable_bootloader_update.sh
```

### Step 3: Enable Bootloader Updates

Use the script previously downloaded to enable bootloader updates:

```bash
./enable_bootloader_update.sh
```

This command will enable the bootloader update functionality on your board.

### Step 4: Power Cycle Your System

After running the bootloader update command:

1. **Power off** your PC completely
2. **Power on** your PC
3. Wait for the system to fully boot up

## Verification

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure the Voyager SDK is properly installed
2. Verify that the bootloader update file was downloaded successfully
3. Check there are no errors displayed on screen
4. Make sure to perform a complete power off and back on again (not just a restart)
