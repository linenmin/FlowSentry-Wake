# Internal demos

The demo maintenance plan can be found on [confluence](https://axeleraai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GotoMarket/pages/1327399045/Demo+maintenance+plan).

Here go the demos that are not ready for release or should stay private. Whenever you create a demo, they first go here until they are tested properly. We can also move demos here if they are no longer supported by a newer release and require hands-on development to make functional again.

A demo may not be promoted to becoming a public demo before someone from the Applications team, and someone from the Product team have signed off on it.
